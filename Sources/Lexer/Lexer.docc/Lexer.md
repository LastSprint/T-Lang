# ``Lexer``

This package contains logic for parsing raw file into AST tree

## Overview

Lexer parses one file to AST (Abstract Sytax Tree) and this AST will be used by other part of the compiler

Lexer doesn't check validity of types or something. 

It just checks that source code is grammatically valid by building AST.
